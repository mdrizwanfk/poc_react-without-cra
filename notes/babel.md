### What is babel plugins and babel presets with examples?

Babel plugins are code transformations that enable specific features or optimizations²³. For example, `@babel/plugin-transform-arrow-functions` converts arrow functions into regular functions².

Babel presets are collections of plugins that support particular language features⁴¹. For example, `@babel/preset-env` includes plugins for ES2015+ syntax⁵.

### What is the difference between Babel and Webpack?

Babel and Webpack are both tools for JavaScript development, but they have different purposes²³.

Babel is a transpiler that converts new JavaScript code into old JavaScript code that runs on all browsers¹². It can also transform syntax and polyfill features using plugins and presets³.

Webpack is a bundler that collects all your assets (such as JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) and bundles them into one or more files that can be loaded by the browser⁴⁵. It can also run Babel as one of its tasks using a loader¹⁵.

Some benefits of using Babel and Webpack together are:

- You can use modules to organize your code into reusable pieces¹².
- You can use JSX with ES6 to write React components more easily¹.
- You can make your code compatible with all web browsers by transpiling and polyfilling new features²³.
- You can use more advanced features such as async/await, decorators, etc. with Babel plugins¹⁴.
- You can remove unused and unnecessary assets from your code, making it cleaner and faster with Webpack optimization²⁴.
